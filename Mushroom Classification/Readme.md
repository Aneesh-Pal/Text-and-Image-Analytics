# Project Title
**Mushroom Classification**


# Aim of the Project
**In this Notebook I will be dealing with the Mushroom Classification by using Decision Tree Classifier using both Entropy and Gini Index.
For the first step of this notebook, I will work on the Exploratory Data Analysis of this dataset by using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly libraries.
For the next step, I will deal with the missing data points (if they exist), and then encode the dataset for the data pre-processing step.
Finally, I will train Decision Tree Classifier Model using both Entropy and Gini Index.**
