# Project Title
## **Mushroom Classification**


# Aim of the Project
**In this Notebook I will be dealing with the Mushroom Classification by using Decision Tree Classifier using both Entropy and Gini Index.
For the first step of this notebook, I will work on the Exploratory Data Analysis of this dataset by using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly libraries.
For the next step, I will deal with the missing data points (if they exist), and then encode the dataset for the data pre-processing step.
Finally, I will train Decision Tree Classifier Model using both Entropy and Gini Index.**

# Required Python Packages and Libraries
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplolib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* Scikit-learn

# Dataset Used:
* mushrooms.csv - The dataset consists of the different features of mushrooms and its class which shows whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.
* The Following project is made on python notebook file so make sure to download the dataset and load the dataset in the Jupiter notebook or google colab before running the project.
# Dataset link:
* Dataset can be downloaded from the following link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JADC6wnnU7Vn8d77fkWPBmp3RWFdZdUj/view?usp=sharing

# Project Implementation:
* Performed Exploratory data analysis.
* Performed Visualization of the features of the mushrooms with respect to its class using matplotlib, seaborn and plolty libraries.

## Model Creation:
* Used Scikit learn library to implement the model.
* Splitted data into training and test data.

## Model Used:
* Classification model Decision Tree Classifier was used.
* Decision Tree was implemented on both criterions 
     * Entropy 
     * Gini Index
